# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

> 🤝 Be kind • 💬 Communicate openly • 🌱 Learn together • 🔄 Repair over punish

**A community agreement for learning data engineering together.**

---

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

---

## How This Actually Works

**We're volunteers, not a formal organization.** This Code of Conduct represents our values and commitments, but we want to be honest about what we can and can't do.

### What We Can Do

**In our spaces (GitHub, Discord, events):**
- Remove harmful content
- Ask someone to take a break if behavior is disruptive
- Help mediate conflicts between community members
- Temporarily or permanently ban for serious, repeated violations
- Listen to concerns and respond thoughtfully

### What We Can't Do

**We don't have:**
- HR departments or legal teams
- Formal investigation capacity like a company would
- Ability to guarantee legal confidentiality
- Authority over your behavior outside our spaces
- Perfect, immediate responses to every situation

### What We Promise

- **Good faith:** We'll act in the community's best interest
- **Transparency:** We'll explain our reasoning when we take action
- **Humility:** We'll admit when we're wrong and learn from mistakes
- **Restorative approach:** We prefer conversation over consequences when possible
- **Consistency:** We'll apply these standards to everyone, including ourselves

> ⚖️ **Fair but Flexible:** We follow guidelines to be consistent, but we recognize that every situation has unique context. We adapt our approach while staying true to our values.

### What We Ask From You

- **Assume good intent first** - Most conflicts are misunderstandings
- **Communicate directly when safe** - Talk to each other before escalating
- **Give grace** - We're all learning, including the stewards
- **Help build culture** - Model the community you want to see
- **Be patient** - We're volunteers balancing this with life and work

> 🤝 **Community Agreement:** This is a community agreement, not a legal contract. We're building trust together, one interaction at a time.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Data Engineering Community Standards

In addition to the standards above, we specifically encourage:

**In Technical Discussions:**
* Welcoming questions at all skill levels—everyone was a beginner once
* Explaining the "why" behind technical suggestions
* Acknowledging multiple valid approaches to problems
* Sharing knowledge without condescension

**In Code Reviews:**
* Focusing feedback on the code, not the person
* Providing actionable, constructive suggestions
* Recognizing good work and progress
* Explaining technical reasoning clearly

**Examples of encouraged behavior:**

> "This approach works, but using a window function here could improve performance. 
> Here's an example: [code]. Happy to discuss trade-offs!"

> "Welcome! That's a great question. Here's a resource that helped me: [link]. 
> Feel free to ask follow-ups!"

**Examples of discouraged behavior:**

* "This is Data Engineering 101. You should know this."
* "Real engineers don't use [tool]. Only [my preferred tool] is acceptable."
* Dismissing questions as "too basic" or mocking technology choices
* Personal attacks like "Your code is garbage" instead of constructive feedback

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

> 👥 **Who are "community leaders"?** These are the Core Stewards listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md). They're volunteers who've taken on this responsibility, not appointed authorities. They can and should be held accountable for their decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

### When External Behavior Matters

> ⚠️ **Exception:** If behavior outside our spaces creates genuine safety concerns **within** our community, we may address it case-by-case.

**Examples where we might act:**
- Coordinated harassment that starts externally but targets community members
- Threats made elsewhere that affect participation here
- Doxxing or privacy violations

**We handle these carefully and transparently, not as blanket enforcement.**

## Enforcement

### How to Report

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by direct message to any Core Steward on Discord.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### What Happens When You Report

**Within 3 days:** You'll receive acknowledgment that we got your report.

**Investigation:** Core Stewards will:
- Review what happened
- Talk to people involved (privately)
- Consider context and impact
- Decide on appropriate response

**Our limitations:**
- We're not trained investigators
- We may not get every detail right
- We balance reporter privacy with fairness to the accused
- We do our best with limited information

**Communication:** We'll tell you what action we're taking, within the bounds of what we can share.

> 🔒 **Privacy Note:** We'll keep reports as confidential as possible, but we're volunteers, not lawyers. We can't guarantee legal confidentiality protections.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

> ⚖️ **Reality check:** These guidelines help us be consistent, but real situations are messy. We may adapt our response based on context, intent, and community impact. We'll always explain our reasoning.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Appeals Process

We're human and we make mistakes. If you believe a decision was unfair, you can appeal.

**How to appeal:**
- Email appeals@os-portfolio-projects.org within 14 days
- Explain why you think the decision was wrong
- Provide any context we may have missed

**What happens:**
- Core Stewards who weren't involved in the original decision will review
- They'll look at all the information again
- They may ask clarifying questions
- They'll make a decision and explain it

**Limitations:**
- The appeal is reviewed by stewards (we don't have external arbitrators)
- The appeals decision is final (we don't have infinite review levels)
- We're doing our best, but we're not a court system

> 🔄 **Learning from mistakes:** If we got something wrong, we'll acknowledge it, apologize, and adjust. These decisions inform how we handle future situations.

## What If I Make a Mistake?

**You probably will. We all do.**

If you realize you said something hurtful or acted inappropriately:

1. **Acknowledge it** - "I realize that came across wrong" or "I shouldn't have said that"
2. **Apologize if appropriate** - Keep it simple and genuine
3. **Learn from it** - Think about what you'd do differently
4. **Move forward** - Don't beat yourself up; we're all learning

**If someone tells you that you've hurt them:**
- Listen without getting defensive
- Thank them for telling you
- Apologize for the impact, even if that wasn't your intent
- Ask what would help repair the situation

> 🔄 **Restorative Focus:** Most conflicts can be resolved through direct, honest conversation. We prefer repair over punishment.
