# Maintainers

**Community Governance for OS-Portfolio-Projects**

This document describes how we collaborate, make decisions, and care for one another while building OS-Portfolio-Projects.

This project is community-first, volunteer-driven, and learning-focused. Our governance exists to support people, not control them.

## Project Vision

OS-Portfolio-Projects exists to help data engineers build production-grade portfolios through collaborative, real-world data systems.

Our community values:

- **People before process** – Sustainability and kindness come first
- **Learning in public** – We grow by building together
- **Shared ownership** – No single person "owns" the project
- **Practical excellence** – We aim for realism, not perfection
- **Open contribution** – Everyone can help shape the platform

---

## Maintainer Roles

Maintainers are stewards, not gatekeepers.

They support contributors, review changes, and help the project move forward.

### Role Types (not ranks)

**Core Stewards** – Facilitate governance, resolve deadlocks, care for the community

**Project Stewards** – Guide specific data product repos

**Community Stewards** – Onboarding, Discord, culture

**Documentation Stewards** – Learning paths, clarity, consistency

People may hold more than one role, and roles can rotate.

## What Maintainers Do

Maintainers help by:

- Reviewing pull requests when available
- Supporting contributors in GitHub and Discord
- Helping projects stay aligned with the vision
- Encouraging good practices and documentation
- Modeling respectful communication

> 💡 **Remember:** There is no minimum time requirement. Life comes first. Participation is flexible.

### If Life Gets Busy

If you need to step back temporarily:

- Just let other stewards know (no formal process)
- We'll adjust responsibilities
- Return whenever ready
- No guilt, no questions asked

If we haven't heard from you in 6 months, we'll check in. You're still valued.

---

## Becoming a Maintainer

Maintainers are invited from active contributors who:

- Collaborate respectfully
- Share knowledge
- Support others
- Show care for the project

### Path to Stewardship

1. A contributor expresses interest or is invited
2. Maintainers discuss openly
3. Community feedback is welcomed
4. The contributor is onboarded with a mentor

> 🤝 **Core Value:** There is no vote threshold — we aim for consensus and trust.

### Onboarding

When someone joins as a steward:

- Paired with a mentor steward
- Added to maintainer channels
- Given repository access as needed
- Introduced to the community
- Supported through first reviews

---

## How We Make Decisions

We follow a lightweight consensus model:

1. **Discuss openly** in issues or Discord
2. **Seek agreement** through conversation
3. **If blocked**, a steward proposes a path forward
4. **We document** the decision and move on

> 🔄 **Living Principle:** If a decision later proves wrong, we change it.

### Types of Decisions

**Everyday Decisions**
- Merging straightforward PRs
- Answering support questions
- Minor documentation updates
- Bug fixes

Any steward can handle these independently.

**Significant Decisions**
- New challenge approvals
- Major feature additions
- Policy changes
- Infrastructure changes

Discuss openly, seek input, move forward when ready.

**Project Direction**
- Governance changes
- Major strategic shifts
- Adding/removing stewards

Core Stewards facilitate, but we aim for broad consensus.

### When Lightweight Doesn't Work

If a decision genuinely can't reach consensus:

- A Core Steward proposes a time-boxed experiment
- We try it for [X weeks/months]
- We evaluate and adjust

We trust that most conflicts resolve through conversation, not votes.

---

## Handling Disagreements

> 🤝 **We assume good intent. No public shaming. No power plays.**

If conflict arises:

1. **Talk it through kindly**
2. **Ask a steward to help mediate**
3. **Pause if emotions run high**
4. **Agree on a path forward**

**No public shaming. No power plays.**

### For Technical Disagreements

- Both approaches may be valid
- Document trade-offs of each
- Try one, learn, adapt if needed
- Remember: we're optimizing for learning

### For Interpersonal Conflicts

- Private conversation first
- Steward mediation if needed
- Focus on behavior, not character
- Seek understanding, then resolution

---

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Violations are handled with:
- **Care** – We're all human
- **Privacy** – Discussions stay private
- **Fairness** – Everyone gets heard
- **Learning** – We focus on growth, not punishment

Serious or repeated violations may result in removal from the community. Core Stewards handle these situations together.

---

## Stepping Back

Anyone may step back at any time — **no explanation needed**.

### Voluntary Transition

If you need to step away:

- Let other stewards know when you can
- We'll transition your responsibilities
- You remain welcome in the community
- You can return whenever ready
